My nickname is <strong>MEFILAS</strong> and i live in Luxembourg (Europe).<br>
I am a diehard long haired metalhead having seen 40+ Iron Maiden shows still 
counting.<br>
I listen to heavy metal since 1999 and collect bootlegs ever since as a 
souvenir.<br>
I trade online and via snail mail. <strong>LOSSLESS ONLY! <br>
</strong>Contact me for any questions or comments.<br>

<br>
Many thanks to all traders and tapers who helped me building up my
collection.<br>
You know who you are!<br>
<br>
Gigs i have been to are marked with this:
